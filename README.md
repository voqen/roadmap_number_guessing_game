# roadmap_number_guessing_game

Within the guessing.py file exists my take on a small CLI back-end project from roadmap.sh, with some of the suggested QOL improvements included.
May be edited in the future, when reflecting on past minor projects.

Clone this repository to use.

Features:
- Easy, Medium & Hard mode
- Guess a number between 1 and 100
- Greater/less-than hints
- congratulatory message + time spent, when completed.
